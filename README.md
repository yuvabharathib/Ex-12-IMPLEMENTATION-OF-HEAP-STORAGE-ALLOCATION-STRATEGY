IMPLEMENTATION OF HEAP STORAGE ALLOCATION STRATEGY
# Date :
# Aim :
To write a program to implement heap storage allocation strategy.
# ALGORITHM
1. Start the program.
2. Define a function create( ) to create a list of allocated node. This function returns a pointer to head of list.
3. Define a function display(node) to display the list of allocated nodes.
4. Define a function search(node,key) to search for the element in list.
5. Define a function insert(node) to insert element into the list.
6. Define a function get_prev(node,value) to look for the previous element in the list.
7. Define a function delete() to remove an element from the list.
8. Stop the program.
# PROGRAM
# OUTPUT
# RESULT
The heap storage allocation strategy is implemented successfully, and the output is 
verified.
